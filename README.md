## Analysis of Los Angeles Restaurants

You have decided to open a small coffee shop with robot waiters in Los Angeles. It is a promising but expensive project, so you and your partners decide to try to attract investors. They are interested in current market conditions and want to know if you will be able to maintain your success once the novelty of robot waiters wears off.

You are an analysis guru, so your partners have asked you to prepare market research. You have open-source data on restaurants in LA.


### Conclusion:

Key recommendations:

* Type:
    - We can proceed with the plan to open a small coffee shop; a fast food restaurant is also an interesting option. Both have similar recommendations in terms of number of seats, less competition (4.5% and 11% of the market, respectively), and opportunities for chain growth.

* Number of seats:
    - In the case of a coffee shop, the average is around 25 seats per establishment, and in the case of a fast food restaurant, 40 seats. 

* Location:
    - The streets with the highest concentration of establishments mainly contain restaurants, with a much smaller number of coffee shops and fast food restaurants. Because of this, I believe it is better to select a location with few establishments, with 657 streets containing only one, to reduce competition and allow the creation of a captive clientele that will keep the establishment operating when the novelty of robots wears off.
    - Another alternative is to choose streets with the highest number of establishments. The high number of competing establishments indicates a heated market that can support another small coffee shop or fast food restaurant. In this case, the focus would be on rapid expansion into a chain.

* Potential for network growth:
    - It is possible to expand the establishment into a network. Both coffee shops and fast food restaurants have a larger market share when we look only at franchised establishments (from 4.5% to 7.2% for coffee shops, and from 11% to 16.5% for fast food restaurants).
